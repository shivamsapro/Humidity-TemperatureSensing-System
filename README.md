# Humidity-TemperatureSensing-System
Our projects presents the calculation and display of humidity and temperature using 
Arduino. it is based on Arduino temperature and humidity sensing DTH11 sensor for 
measurement and it is distinctive because it not only reads the value of temperature and 
humidity from sensor but also stores and display the data on screen (serial monitor) and 
other devices like (firebase, Thing speak) and in this project we have used firebase in which 
data can be shown.
